# Simple Collide and Slide Unity Script

This contains a unity script that contains a few iterations for a simple collide and slide character motor. 
As of right now it barely functions but I'll be working on it in the future to suit my needs.

The code is an edited version as from this video:

Use:
- currently I'd recommend using the MoveMK3 function
  - this has more of the usecase I'm lookingfor 

Whats next:
- I'm planning on adding a velocity handler to this.
- That way it will be able to internally handle it's velocity.
- For as of right now I'm hitting an issue with not claming the velocity when I'm pushed against a wall or something.
